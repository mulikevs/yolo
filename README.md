# 🛍️ YOLO E-Commerce Application

This is a full-stack e-commerce platform that functions both as a customer-facing storefront and an admin dashboard for managing products. The application is built using **React** for the frontend, **Node.js/Express** for the backend, and **MongoDB** for the database.

The project is containerized using Docker and follows a microservices architecture, making it easy to deploy and scale. It includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage services and a `Jenkinsfile` to support CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates:

- Microservices deployment using Docker containers
- Backend REST API for managing products
- Frontend React dashboard and product storefront
- CI/CD automation via Jenkins
- MongoDB as the primary data store

docker pull mulikevs/mulikevs-yolo-client:v1.0.0 # frontend

docker pull mulikevs/mulikevs-yolo-client:v1.0.0 # Backend
```

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure all required ports (3000, 5000) are free before starting.
- MongoDB is running as a separate container.
- Environment variables (if any) can be set using a `.env` file or directly within Docker Compose.

---

## 🧼 Troubleshooting

- **Port conflict?** Kill any process using port 3000 or 5000.
- **Docker build errors?** Try clearing cache using `docker system prune -a`.
